From the 6 different play testers, I recieved a bunch of great feedback. Most of the feedback
that came from thenm focused on the Camera and how they couldn't see enought information that
was needed. Some people said to center the Camera, others said to view the entire map, So what I did
was I changed the center of the camera to be focused on the Cube, and on top of this, I made it so
that players can adjust the offset of the Camera so that they can "find" the necessary information
around them. I did not want to show the players the whole map at all times, as I wanted players to
frequently memorize old paths. Seeing all different maps at any given time would make the game 
much easier. Another thing I added from feedback was include Spacebar to jump on top of up arrow, as
some people have their preferences. Playtesters also commented on the fact that they didn't know when
they had died or won and would have liked an indicator, so I added winning and death particles, and on
top of that, I added distinct sound for both winning and dying. I also added Audio for Jumping, Switching
Gravity, and Teleporting. One other thing I heard from a playtester was that they wanted an gravity
direction indcator. I wanted to add this as well and thought it would be a great addition, but I 
couldn't get around to it since I thought it was a low priority task, and I need to sleep. Some of the
playtesters also talked about having the ability to teleport and/or switch gravity without having to touch
the ground. I did not add this since it would make many of my obstacles obselete and pointless, since you
could simply "fly" by switching on and off gravity.
